## What's this?
A favorite recipe of mine. Turkish ravioli/dumplings.
Based on a combination of information from
[THESE!](http://www.panningtheglobe.com/2013/11/05/turkish-manti/)
[THREE!](http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/manti/)
[SOURCES!](https://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2013/12/manti-the-tiny-treasuresturkish-dumplings-stuffed-with-ground-meat-in-garlic-yoghurt-and-spices/)

## Pronunciation
Kinda like "mahn-tuh", according to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bybqy29e7Yw).

## Servings
Like, four. Maybe six.

## Time

A solid afternoon.
Dough should rest for 30 minutes. The most time-consuming part by far could be
the folding of the dumplings, but that totally depends on how small you make them.

## Do it to it

### General Prep
  1. Zest the lemon.
  1. Chop the parsley finely. It's for taste.
  1. Chop the mint coarsely. It's for taste and decoration.
  1. Chop the small onion. Mince it!

### Make the Dough
  1. Pour flour and salt into a pile on a work surface or large board.   
  1. Make a well in the center of the flour and crack the egg into it.  
  1. With a fork, mix the egg and incorporate the flour.  
  1. When the mixture is too thick for stirring with a fork, start using your hands to mix everything together, gradually adding the water, as you start to knead and press the dough.
  1. Add the olive oil and salt at this point. It should be smoothish - I had to add more water.
  1. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until you get a firm, smooth dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.

### Preheat the oven to 325 now
Don't forget this part.

### Prepare the filling
While the dough rests, combine lamb/beef, onion, parsley and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

### Prepare the yogurt sauce
Mix all the yogurt sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Put the bowl in the fridge. (Bring to room temp before serving.)

### Fill the manti
  1. (Prep for later) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set it aside.
  1. Cut the dough into (more manageable) fourths
  1. Roll dough on floured surface, into a thin sheet, about 1/16 of an inch thick.
  1. Use a knife or a pizza cutter to cut into 1Â½-inch squares. This makes A LOT of SMALL manti. Feel free to make them bigger.
  1. Add a small ball of meat (about the size of a chickpea) to the center of each square. (Or a larger ball if you made larger squares.)
  1. Pull the four corners up around the meat and press the four side seams firmly together to seal.
  1. Repeat with the rest of the dough. This came out to about 120 of them (which took a long time).
  1. Set manti onto that baking sheet with the parchment paper from before

### Bake the manti (do tomato sauce while these bake)
  1. Bake manti for 15 minutes, until it just starts to brown.
  1. While baking: Start boiling a large pot of water, and start the tomato sauce.
  1. Allow to come to room temp before continuing. (You can also store them in the fridge for up to a day or in the freezer for up to two weeks.)

### Prepare the tomato sauce (do this while manti is baking)
  1. Cook the oil and tomato paste in a small pot over medium low heat, stirring constantly, for about 7 minutes, until you get a deep rich color and oil is incorporated.
  1. Add paprika and red pepper and stir for 30 seconds longer.
  1. Remove from heat. Add water, then whisk to combine.
  1. Set aside - keep this ready to reheat just before serving.

### Boil the manti (at the same time as the butter sauce)
  1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
  1. Add manti and cook at a gentle boil 10-12 minutes, until tender.
  1. While this is happening start on the butter sauce below, and warm up the tomato sauce.
  1. Drain and return manti to its cooking pot.

### Prepare butter sauce (do this while manti is boiling)
  1. Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
  1. Whisk constantly for 1-3 minutes, until you see little brown flecks appear.
  1. Remove from heat, add olive oil, and set aside to add to the manti once it's done boiling.

### Finishing up
  1. Pour butter sauce over and toss to coat, reheating gently, if need be.
  1. Taste test! Season with salt as needed.
  1. Divide manti between ~6~ 4 bowls and spoon on the tomato sauce and yogurt.
  1. Drizzle on any extra butter sauce.
  1. Top with lemon zest and chopped mint.

Enjoy!
