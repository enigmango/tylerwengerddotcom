## The Basics

My name's Tyler! Thanks for visiting.

## Personal

I currently live in Cincinnati, where small lizards rule with tiny iron fists. I love a good breakfast/crossword combo.

* Reading: The Unnoticeables
* Listening: Any playlists good for unpacking
* Watching: Murdoch Mysteries
* Playing: (Yup, still) Hitman
* And [here's a random Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random).

## Professional

I have a degree in computer engineering from the University of Akron, and I work for [Cloudreach](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Cloudreach-EI_IE439504.11,21.htm) as a Cloud Systems Developer Lead.

## Contact

If you've found this website, then you're a capable person (also probably very smart and funny) and I'm sure you can find me on the standard social media sites.

## Technical

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Gitlab CI, and hosted on AWS. The full source code can be found [in this repo](https://gitlab.com/tywe/tylerwengerddotcom).

## Other projects

I recently built a silly project that transposes the first letters
(like a [Spoonerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism)) of random Wikipedia titles.
You can [generate your own here](http://wikibot.wengerd.org) or
check out the [Twitter bot that shouts random results into the void](https://twitter.com/wiki_transposed).

I also wrote a [Twitter bot that posts only the parentheticals from the 45th president's Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/potus_in_parens).

## What does "GmbH" mean?

[Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_mit_beschr%C3%A4nkter_Haftung)

## Et Cetera

This site is run on the honor system. Play fair.
