	            <p>The caret is a practically nonexistent being in the world of punctuation.</p>

<p>The caret is a long-stale relic of the circumflex, the mildly useful overstrike from a time lost. Who needs such a bendy thing these days? The caret has been ritually driven out by more practical alternatives. The youth of this world don&rsquo;t even know what a caret is. It&rsquo;s been covered up by its own uselessness to the point that it wouldn&rsquo;t even know how to describe itself. Upward pointing? Pah. We have arrows for that. Shark fins and mountain ranges? It just can&rsquo;t beat the real thing. Any merit the caret could have ever had in days past has been dissolved, and the caret can&rsquo;t expect to stay harbored in its own shadowy waters and not suffocate. The caret is pointless (in spite of the pun). The caret is forgotten.</p>

<p>The caret? The caret is dead.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what some would have you believe, anyway.</p>

<p>The truth? The caret isn&rsquo;t an silly lifeform made up of organic compounds. It&rsquo;s not destined to age and decompose - rather, it&rsquo;s an idea that you and millions of people like you (and unlike you [and sort of like you, you know, maybe they have a similar personality but they&rsquo;ve never been paralyzed by a panther&rsquo;s vicious gaze, now have they?]) have breathed life into. No matter how rarely you use it when you text your pals, draft a grocery list, or revise your personal tagline, you may someday use it when you dabble in ASCII art. It doesn&rsquo;t die unless you (and those other people, remember them?) want it to.</p>

<p><sub><em>This article is part of a series on <a href="/tags/punctuation"><strong>punctuation</strong></a>. It&rsquo;s pretty much all made up. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the prowess of a panther, though. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</em></sub></p>
