	            <p>The asterisk is an elusive being in the world of punctuation.
It is most often used in texts such as books, articles, and Web Logs (commonly shortened to &ldquo;blogs&rdquo;) to distract you from the issue at hand* and give you something to look forward to;
if one shows up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that there may be more lying in wait. Like vicious panthers.
Panthers of distraction.</p>

<p>The asterisk originated in the late 1700s by Captain James Cook, who,
upon mapping the eastern coast of the Australian continent,
was driven mad by the sight of a small herd of echidnas,
drawing the little blighters in all his reports from that point on.
This is why the asterisk is also used as a &ldquo;wild card&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This was loved by the general public; upon reading all his reports on his livejournal
(a paper-based system at the time)
the mark spread rapidly as a way of making little side notes,
mainly because they didn&rsquo;t have any punctuation for that sort of thing at the time,
and this seemed good enough.
Giving the critters eyes seemed a little creepy, though, so they just went with five or six points, or whatever.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;asterisk&rdquo; itself was coined because there wasn&rsquo;t anything separating asterion and astern in the dictionary yet,
and people in med school simply DETESTED being associated in any way with those vulgar sailing folks.</p>

<p>* 10²+ 11² + 12² = 13² + 14²</p>

<p><sub><em>This article is part of a series on <a href="/tags/punctuation"><strong>punctuation</strong></a>. It&rsquo;s pretty much all made up.
Don&rsquo;t underestimate the prowess of a panther, though.
You&rsquo;ve been warned.</em></sub></p>
