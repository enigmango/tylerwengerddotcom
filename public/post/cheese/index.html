<p>Something&rsquo;s different.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve turned into a piece of cheese.</p>

<p>Maybe two pieces, actually, or maybe more. You can&rsquo;t really tell (cheese can&rsquo;t count).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not pay too much attention to The Why of this event; doing so would lead us down a trail of rennet, Streptococci, and Gewürztraminer. Instead, let&rsquo;s focus on The What.</p>

<h2 id="the-why">THE WHY</h2>

<p>Pretty sure I said let&rsquo;s not pay too mu</p>

<h2 id="the-what">THE WHAT</h2>

<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re cheese now. But <em>which cheese</em> are you? There are SO MANY. If only you&rsquo;d turned into a mandolin, this would be different, this would be easy, this would end with you being a flatback mandolin because everyone&rsquo;s a flatback mandolin.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can figure out what kind of cheese you are by forcing you to compare your personality traits with increasingly whimsical cheese textures from a laughably small sample of cheeses.</p>

<h2 id="1-cheddar">1. Cheddar</h2>

<p><img src="/img/cheese/cheddar.jpg" alt="Some Cheddar and crackers" title="Aw yeah Cheddar"></p>

<p>Cheddar is a <strong>compact</strong> cheese. When you walk around in a hoodie, do you mainly keep your hands in the pockets of the hoodie, or do you keep them elsewhere? If you&rsquo;re a hoodie-pocket-dweller, you&rsquo;re a Cheddar. Also, in this world where you&rsquo;ve turned to cheese, there&rsquo;s a compact car called the Mazda Cheddar because it&rsquo;s hilarious and you were the only thing holding it back in your old world.</p>

<h2 id="2-brie">2. Brie</h2>

<p><img src="/img/cheese/brie.jpg" alt="Brie on a wood surface" title="Mmm mmm Brie"></p>

<p>Brie is a <strong>runny</strong> cheese.  Given time, this cheese will only increase in runniness. We&rsquo;re talking straight up milk, with absolutely no regrets. If you&rsquo;re into that, you&rsquo;re Brie. If you&rsquo;re not sure, that&rsquo;s perfectly natural and I recommend moving on.</p>

<h2 id="3-danbo">3. Danbo</h2>

<p><img src="/img/cheese/danbo.jpg" alt="Danbo and crackers" title="Yum, Danbo"></p>

<p>Danbo is a <strong>springy</strong> cheese. Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking this is the cheese for resilient, optimistic types. Wrong-o! This is the cheese for people who say &ldquo;wrong-o&rdquo;! If you&rsquo;ve added &ldquo;-o!&rdquo; to other words, you&rsquo;re also Danbo (unless those words were contractions, you monster).</p>

<h2 id="4-neufchâtel">4. Neufchâtel</h2>

<p><img src="/img/cheese/neuf.jpg" alt="Neufchâtel on a wood surface with a wood utensil" title="Woohoo, Neufchâtel | Attribution: Mumumío [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons"></p>

<p>Neufchâtel is a <strong>grainy</strong> cheese, but don&rsquo;t worry about that. As it&rsquo;s often sold in heart shapes, you&rsquo;re almost certainly Neufchâtel if you sculpt your food into a heart before eating it.</p>

<h2 id="5-paneer">5. Paneer</h2>

<p><img src="/img/cheese/paneer.jpg" alt="Stacked Paneer" title="Sweeeeet, Paneer | Attribution: By fugzu (Flickr: paneer) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons"></p>

<p>Paneer is a <strong>chewy</strong> cheese.
<em>Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm</em><br />
Never mind, you&rsquo;re not Paneer.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t matched yourself with any of these cheeses, you probably weren&rsquo;t a human to begin with. Or you&rsquo;re a flatback mandolin.</p>
