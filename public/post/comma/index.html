	            <p>The comma is a ravenous mostly-deep-sea-but-sometimes-shallow-sea being in the world of punctuation.</p>

<p>Born in the late 1030s, the comma lived most of its early life under King Edward the Confessor. At that time, it was simply a line, or a mark. Sometimes people even called it Mark (never Marky, though).</p>

<p>When things in the House of Wessex got, well, <em>just too crazy</em>, the comma (Mark) got fed up, and a little peckish, and dove into the nearest body of water (perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solent">the Solent</a>).</p>

<p>After a short amount of time—a mere eight months—the comma became more fin-like, allowing it to glide through the water more easily. That change marked (or commaed) the end of a world where any text could just swim anywhere, now helpless against the comma&rsquo;s superior speed, strength, and fed-upness. Note that text could still travel by sea, just not <em>in</em> the sea—the period got around just fine with its pirate ships, as you know.</p>

<p>Currently, the comma covers approximately 70% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface (the idea that 70% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface is covered by panthers is a common misconception). It still rises from the depths now and then to surge and stab at the pieces of text that dare drift into its territory, making them pause for a bit and sometimes even explain themselves. It&rsquo;s all very inconvenient.</p>

<p><sub><em>This article is part of a series on <a href="/tags/punctuation"><strong>punctuation</strong></a>. It&rsquo;s pretty much all made up. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the prowess of a panther, though. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</em></sub></p>
